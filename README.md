sorry but react code is a bit messy, and not comment out properly, i didn't had much left before the deadline

### IITK Attendence App

React-based web application for managing student attendance. It includes features for logging in, marking attendance, adding students, and retrieving attendance records, all features using a face-recognition by python with flask backend

Refer Demo:- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dHEqofvBiVSwp0DsM_fATmrwoBwefYhS/view?usp=sharing for how to use

frontend:-https://github.com/this-is-mjk/Attendance-App.git

backend:- https://github.com/this-is-mjk/Attendance-app-backend.git

refer the README in the backend for better understanding the backend implementation

### Scope of improvement

1. increase the readablity
2. organise the files and fucntions in a better way.
3. understand the concepts of useEffect, hooks, ects in deep, currently i face a bit issue in this topic
4. Reduce copy pasting, increase typing you myself even when i just following the tutorial online, or only online resource.
5. I was not able to deploy the project completely 
   backend was not deployed
   fronted is on vercel :- https://attendance-app-seven.vercel.app
